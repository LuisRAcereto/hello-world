Creating my new repository in Git

Hi fellas,

LRA here. I am ScrumMaster trying to keep on with the current technology, so I am learning a base of technologies to keep my tech skills sharp, such as Node, Angular, Cordova, new JavaScript techniques, etc.
I like all kinds of food, although my native food definitevely it is my favorite.
